Power and Wiring
1 x 4S 5000 mAh 50C LiPo Battery with XT60 ($59.99)
^ Quote from Squirm Tech: "LiPo batteries power the T200 thrusters and the Pixhawk. According to Blue Robotics, the T200 thrusters are optimized for use with a 4S LiPo (16 V). However, the T200 thrusters can operate at voltages ranging from 7-20 V. We chose a 4S LiPo based off the information provided by Blue Robotics and it works great. That said, it appears that you have some flexibility when choosing a battery."
